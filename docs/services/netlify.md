# Netlify

Right now I haven't found a way to use the [Netlify builds](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/get-started/) to deploy a page. Instead I recommend to use the [Netlify CLI](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/) and use your local machine or any other CI tool.  
But at all the exported static files are compatible with Netlify.
